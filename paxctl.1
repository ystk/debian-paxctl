.SH NAME
\fBpaxctl\fR - user-space utility to control PaX flags
.SH SYNTAX
\fBpaxctl\fR <flags> <files>
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpaxctl\fR is a tool that allows PaX flags to be modified
on a per-binary basis.  PaX is part of common security-enhancing
kernel patches and secure distributions, such as GrSecurity or
Adamantix and Hardened Gentoo, respectively.  Your system needs
to be running a properly patched and configured kernel for
this program to have any effect.

.SH CAVEATS
The old PaX flag location and control method have been obsoleted,
if your kernel and binaries use it you have to use chpax(1) instead
(it is recommended to use PT_PAX_FLAGS along with -c or -C however).

Converting PT_GNU_STACK into PT_PAX_FLAGS means that the information
in the former is destroyed, in particular you must make sure that
the EMUTRAMP PaX option is properly set in the newly created PT_PAX_FLAGS.

The secure way is to disable EMUTRAMP first and if PaX reports stack
execution attempts from nested function trampolines then enable it.

Note that the new PT_PAX_FLAGS is created in the same state that
binutils/ld itself would produce (equivalent to -zex).

Note that paxctl does not make backup copies of the files it modifies.
